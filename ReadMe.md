# A Clock App to display local server's time in milliseconds

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo and install dependencies
    - Make sure to have git installed. Using your Terminal (if you are on Mac or Linux, or Powershell if you are on Windows). Navigate to a preferred directory, and <code>git clone https://github.com/trancethehuman/clock-app.git</code> in there.
    - After cloning is complete, navigate to <code>/server</code> in your Terminal/Powershell folder and install all dependencies for the server side using the command <code>npm install</code>.
    - Once the dependency installation process for server is done, navigate to <code>/client</code> and run <code>npm install</code> to do the same for client side.
2. Start NodeJS Server
   - Navigate back to <code>/server</code> in your terminal, run the command <code>node src/index.js</code> to start local NodeJS server on port 3000.
3. Start local React Development Server
   - Navigate back to <code>/client</code> in your terminal, run the command <code>npm start</code> to start local React development server on port 3001. Your default web browser should open up when the server is started successfully.
   - If your browser doesn't open automatically, using Chrome or any other browsers, go to <code>localhost:3001</code>. This is where the client-side front-end will be.
